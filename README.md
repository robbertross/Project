==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time domain. For a description of the variables, see CodeBook.txt

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Subject ID
- Activity Type
- Set of means of time domain variables (See CodeBook.txt)

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'CodeBook.txt': Shows information about the variables.

- 'tidyDB.txt': Dataset

- 'run_analysis.R': Commented script for cleaning original dataset

If you want to re-run the data cleaning script, please make sure that the original data files are available in the following location:

./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt
./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt

The cleaning script is commented and self-explanatory.
